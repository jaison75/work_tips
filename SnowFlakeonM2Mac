Snowflake Driver installation on M2
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69275130/how-do-i-install-the-odbc-driver-for-snowflake-successfully-on-an-m1-apple-silic

Had to resort to x86_64 architecture
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

arch -x86_64 /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew install unixodbc
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew install --cask rstudio
arch -x86_64 /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew install --cask r

We then need to install the snowflake driver: https://sfc-repo.snowflakecomputing.com/odbc/mac64/latest/index.html

Click through all the install prompts.

Modify your files

/usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini:

[Snowflake Driver]
Driver          = /opt/snowflake/snowflakeodbc/lib/universal/libSnowflake.dylib
/usr/local/etc/odbc.ini

[Snowflake]
Driver             = Snowflake Driver
uid                = <uid>
server             = <server>
role               = <role>
warehouse          = <warehouse>
authenticator      = externalbrowser
We also need to modify the simba.snowflake.ini file.

It is somewhat locked down so run:

sudo chmod 646 /opt/snowflake/snowflakeodbc/lib/universal/simba.snowflake.ini
Then

vim /opt/snowflake/snowflakeodbc/lib/universal/simba.snowflake.ini
And find the ODBCInstLib line that is uncommented and change it to:

ODBCInstLib=/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.9_1/lib/libodbcinst.dylib
After setting this up I was able to use this connection successfully:

install.packages("DBI")
install.packages("odbc")
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "Snowflake")
